# CEFSimplifiedVS17
A Visual Studio 2017 C# Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) project for testing ClickOnce.

The main branch was referred to as 'master' but from october 2020 on GitHub decided to use the word 'main' instead.

In this repository we still use the old name and you can find the project and its source code in the 'master' branch.
